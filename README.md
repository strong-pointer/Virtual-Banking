# Virtual-Banking
The program is meant to simulate a virtual banker that can provide info on a potential mortgage (i.e. if you qualify or not).
This demonstrates the Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern and OOP I had learned in one of my software engineering courses.

Because this project was earlier on in my college career, it had provided me with good practice and important knowledge of the before-mentioned subjects.
